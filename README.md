# MachineLearningQuantitativeMethodsAnalysis

I want to test the effectivness of non-linear multilayer neural networks on prediciting the value of companies on the market.

I aim to test the network on historical data in increments of 1 month periods and sub divide neural networks based on the relative value per share, their market sector as well as their country of origin. As an example I would run a neural network on 'Agricultural Companies In Australia' and the network would be fed with examples of a companies share prices of a 2-5 year period with the intention of predicting the increase or decrease of the share price in the coming month. Another layer of absraction to be implimented at a later date would be to include fundamental data in the analysis too, i.e. feeding the program news articles from the period and using that to influence the output also.
